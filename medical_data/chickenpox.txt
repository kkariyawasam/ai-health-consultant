What is chickenpox and what causes it?

Chickenpox, also called varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This virus is a member of the herpesvirus family, and humans are the only known natural hosts for it. VZV is found worldwide. The initial infection with VZV results in chickenpox. After someone recovers from chickenpox, the virus becomes inactive in the nerve cells. It can reactivate later, leading to a painful condition known as shingles (herpes zoster). The virus spreads when someone with chickenpox coughs or sneezes, releasing infected droplets into the air, and through direct contact with the fluid from the chickenpox blisters. If a person is susceptible (meaning they haven't had chickenpox or been vaccinated), they are likely to contract the virus if exposed. Chickenpox tends to occur more often during winter and spring or cool and dry months, with outbreaks occurring every 2–5 years. While typically mild in children, it can be more severe in adults.


What are the signs and symptoms?

The most noticeable sign of chickenpox is an itchy rash that turns into small, fluid-filled blisters. This rash often starts on the scalp and face before spreading to the trunk and limbs. It can be preceded by a few days of fever, general discomfort (malaise) and loss of appetite. The rash develops over about five to seven days, progressing from flat spots (macules) to raised bumps (papules), then to itchy blisters (vesicles) and finally to scabs. Unvaccinated individuals typically develop around 300 lesions. These blisters eventually dry out, and crusts form and then disappear over one to two weeks. The time from exposure to the virus to the appearance of the rash (the incubation period) is usually 14–16 days, with a range of 10–21 days. The virus is contagious one to two days before the rash appears and until all the lesions are crusted over.


How does chickenpox spread?

Chickenpox is very contagious and spreads in several ways. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing droplets containing the virus. The virus can also spread through direct contact with the fluid from chickenpox blisters or respiratory secretions. A person is contagious from one to two days before the rash appears until all the blisters have formed scabs. This ease of transmission is why chickenpox can easily spread in places like schools and daycare centres. The secondary attack rate for chickenpox is high, with 61–100% of susceptible individuals contracting the disease after being exposed.


What are the possible complications?

While chickenpox is usually a mild illness, it can lead to complications, particularly in certain groups of people. These complications can include pneumonia (lung infection), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and bacterial infections of the skin. These complications can be severe and sometimes fatal. Although severe complications are more likely in individuals with weakened immune systems, most deaths from chickenpox occur in otherwise healthy children because the disease is so common. Those at higher risk for severe complications include infants under one year of age, pregnant women, adults and people with compromised immune systems.


How long does chickenpox last from start to finish?

The chickenpox rash typically appears within 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The rash takes about 5-7 days to fully develop from flat spots to blisters and then scabs. The scabs typically fall off within one to two weeks. Thus, the full course of chickenpox, from the first sign of the rash to the disappearance of scabs, can last approximately 2 to 4 weeks. Importantly, a person is contagious until all lesions have crusted over. Once the scabs have formed, the risk of transmitting the virus is greatly reduced.

Can someone get chickenpox more than once in their lifetime?

Usually, a person will only get chickenpox once in their life. After recovery, their body develops immunity to the virus. The virus then remains inactive in the nerve cells but may reactivate later in life to cause shingles. While it's rare, some people who have been vaccinated can develop a mild case of chickenpox known as "breakthrough varicella". This is usually less severe than the disease in unvaccinated individuals.
